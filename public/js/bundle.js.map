The\n\t    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t    registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t     Terminology\n\t    -----------\n\t     - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t     A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t     Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t     Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t    itself fulfill.\n\t      Basic Usage:\n\t    ------------\n\t     ```js\n\t    var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t      // on success\n\t      resolve(value);\n\t       // on failure\n\t      reject(reason);\n\t    });\n\t     promise.then(function(value) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Advanced Usage:\n\t    ---------------\n\t     Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t     ```js\n\t    function getJSON(url) {\n\t      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t         xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t        xhr.send();\n\t         function handler() {\n\t          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t            if (this.status === 200) {\n\t              resolve(this.response);\n\t            } else {\n\t              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t            }\n\t          }\n\t        };\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t     getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t     ```js\n\t    Promise.all([\n\t      getJSON('/posts'),\n\t      getJSON('/comments')\n\t    ]).then(function(values){\n\t      values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t       return values;\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     @class Promise\n\t    @param {function} resolver\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @constructor\n\t  */\n\t  function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n\t    this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n\t    this._state = undefined;\n\t    this._result = undefined;\n\t    this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t    if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n\t      typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n\t      this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\t\n\t  lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n\t    constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t       ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t       Chaining\n\t      --------\n\t       The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

comments are now available\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t       If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t       ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t      }).then(function (comments) {\n\t        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t      }, function (reason)

The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n
